# Experiments for the NeurIPS Submission: A Global Optimal Portfolio for m-Sparse Sharpe Ratio Maximization (mSSRM)
There are 2 folders. Please read the README.md file in each folder to find how to use the corresponding contents.

1. `Codes_for_Experiments_in_Paper` contains the Matlab codes of mSSRM for the experiments already in the paper. 
2. `Codes_for_Simulation` contains the simulation codes for testing validation of PGA's global optimality.
